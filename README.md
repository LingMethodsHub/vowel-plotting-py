# vowel-plotting

This is an unhelpful readme which will tell you to see the text blocks in the notebook!

This notebook is intended to help beginning phonetics students produce plots of their own vowels. If you are neither a beginning phonetics student nor a teacher of beginning phonetics students, you may still find the function defined within the notebook useful for a quick way to produce nice-looking (in my opinion) vowel plots.

vowel-plotting.ipynb is a notebook that walks through the steps of making a vowel plot

demo-vowels.csv is a set of sample vowels, and Flege_94_vowels.csv is another dataset for demos.
